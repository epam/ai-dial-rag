    "# Indexing API Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Indexing API of the Dial RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dial RAG can automatically run indexing for a new documents it sees in RAG or retrieval requests. However, you can also manually index documents using the Indexing API. It may be useful if you know the document in advance and do not want to wait for the automatic indexing during the first request, or if you want to attribute the costs of the indexing to a separate Dial API-Key. Also, the indexing API allows you to manually manage the path to the index storage, which can be useful if you have some custom pipeline which involves copying/moving the documents after indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step example which covers uploading files to Dial, calling Dial RAG Indexing API to index the files, describes the results of the indexing, and demonstrates how to use the custom paths to the index files in the Dial storage."
